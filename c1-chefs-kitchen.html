To learn and grow

11/2/2014

After watching Shereefâ€™s fireside chat my take is that the DBC is a completely different educational and learning experience. Its a very opened minded concept and is constantly evolving and I believe will continue to change because of the feedback they are open to. It is a total learning experience mind, body, coding and emotional intelligence.

My impression of DBC is that this is a great way to learn. Leave your ego at the door be open minded. Also it also seems very organized yet flexible. Im ready to dive in and put the quality time in. Working on this weeks material has me excited.

I see myself fully committing to the DBC type of culture. I have been making arrangements to be able to focus on the program. It will have its challenges but thats ok thats part of the process.

My expectations of DBC remain high. I had been following DBC since its first location in San Francisco and was hoping it would come to New York. I had a good feeling it would and had waited patiently for that time to come and it is here way to go DBC.

I am so excited to work in this kind of working environment, I know it will be tough and have reflected on how hard it might get but I am confident that if I keep my open mindset and dedicate myself to the team and learning not just code but about my fellow cohorts and myself . Life is a journey and this is the one path that will challenge me but thats ok thats part of the growing and learning process.

Im a little nervous but its a good nervous, this will be a great overall experience. Although I live in Long Island New York which is a suburb, this will be my third commute to the Big Apple. The first was traveling by bus and 3 trains to midtown to my high school Power Memorial Academy for 4 years, the second journey was working in a network technology unit for the city. Both great experiences. Looking forward to my third commute, I will use my commuting time for reading and napping.
