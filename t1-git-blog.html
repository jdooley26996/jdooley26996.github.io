The power of git Github and the command line

My first week on the command line

11/2/2014

Before I get into what these programs can do and there benefits I just want to let you know this is my first week working with these programs. However I have learned a lot in a short period of time. The biggest benefit is that you can navigate faster from the command line instead using the GUI graphic user interface which is what Iâ€™m use to. Git is run from the command line from the terminal program from a mac and you can connect to Github which is located on the web. You have to create a Github account online and its free. Git and Github can be connected by using the remote commands from the command line in your terminal program. Then you can push or pull your files from your computer or from the internet. This is a great way to back up your files. Another cool feature is version control. Git has commands you can type in to save images after a change has been made and you are ready to upload it. git add stages the file before you commit and that is the second command it is commit this makes the changes and adds a kind of time stamp to when the file was modified.

Please check into my blog for future posts, I hope it was helpful.
